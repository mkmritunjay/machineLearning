        "Neural Networks are a machine learning framework that attempts to mimic the learning pattern of natural biological neural networks. Biological neural networks have interconnected neurons with dendrites that receive inputs, then based on these inputs they produce an output signal through an axon to another neuron. We will try to mimic this process through the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which we will just refer to as neural networks from now on. The process of creating a neural network begins with the most basic form, a single perceptron.\n",

        " \n",
        "Let's start our discussion by talking about the Perceptron! A perceptron has one or more inputs, a bias, an activation function, and a single output. The perceptron receives inputs, multiplies them by some weight, and then passes them into an activation function to produce an output. There are many possible activation functions to choose from, such as the logistic function, a trigonometric function, a step function etc. We also make sure to add a bias to the perceptron, this avoids issues where all inputs could be equal to zero (meaning no multiplicative weight would have an effect).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "Once we have the output we can compare it to a known label and adjust the weights accordingly (the weights usually start off with random initialization values). We keep repeating this process until we have reached a maximum number of allowed iterations, or an acceptable error rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create a neural network, we simply begin to add layers of perceptrons together, creating a multi-layer perceptron model of a neural network. You'll have an input layer which directly takes in your feature inputs and an output layer which will create the resulting outputs. Any layers in between are known as hidden layers because they don't directly \"see\" the feature inputs or outputs.\n"

        "- A time series is a set of observations generated, sequentially in time, on a single variable\n",
        "- Time periods are of equal length (days, weeks, months, quarters, annual)\n",
        "- Time series analysis accounts for the fact that data points taken over time may have an internal structure (such as auto correlation, trend or seasonal variation) that should be accounted for\n",
        "- Time series data is indexed by time and No missing values\n",
        "\n",
        "> Time series data is ubiquitous, both within and outside of the data science field: weekly initial unemployment claims, tick level stock prices, weekly company sales, daily number of steps taken recorded by a wearable, just to name a few. Some of the most important and commonly used data science techniques to analyze time series data are those in developed in the field of statistics. For this reason, time series statistical models should be included in any data scientist's toolkit.\n",

        "Time series analysis and modeling have many business and social applications. It is extensively used to forecast company sales, product demand, stock market trends, agricultural production etc.\n",
        "The fundamental idea for time series analysis is to decompose the original time series (sales, stock market trends, etc.) into several independent components. Typically, business time series are divided into the following four components:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Trend – overall direction of the series i.e. upwards, downwards etc.\n",
        "- Seasonality – monthly or quarterly patterns\n",
        "- Cycle – long-term business cycles, they usually come after 5 or 7 years\n",
        "- Irregular remainder – random noise left after extraction of all the components\n",
        "\n",
        "Interference of these components produces the final series.\n",
        "Why bother decomposing the original / actual time series into components? It is much easier to forecast the individual regular patterns produced through decomposition of time series than the actual series.\n",

        "##### Components: Time Series can be decomposed into 4 components\n",
        "- Trend: Trend is the gradual, long-run (or secular) evolution of the variables that we are seeking to forecast.\n",
        "- Seasonal Effects: Many series display a regular pattern of variability depending on the time of year. This pattern is known as the seasonal effect.\n",
        "- Cyclic Component: Fluctuations around the trend, excluding the irregular component, revealing a succession of phases of expansion and contraction.\n",
